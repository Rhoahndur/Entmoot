  Wave 1 Focus: Foundation - Data Ingestion & Validation

  Parallel Execution Strategy:
  - Story 1.1 must complete first (foundation)
  - Then Stories 1.2, 1.3, 1.5 run in parallel (3 developers)
  - Story 1.4 runs after 1.3 completes
  - Story 1.6 runs after 1.2 and 1.3 complete

  Team Assignment:
  - DEV-1: Stories 1.1, 1.4, 1.6 (collaboration with ARCH)
  - DEV-2: Stories 1.2, 1.5
  - DEV-3: Story 1.3
